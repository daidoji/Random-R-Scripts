Random-R-Scripts
================
Various R scripts I'm using while working through 
http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/cat_36-402.html
in an attempt to better my R skills and statistical knowledge.

They're not very good as I'm rushing through it and the quality leaves much 
to be desired.  If you're in Doctor Shalizi's class praise your good luck for 
being able to study under a modern day genius and definently don't cheat 
off of my poor work.
